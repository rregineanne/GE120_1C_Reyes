    Procedural programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) are two different programming paradigms. The first one is focused on 
using a step-by-step code in executing the problem. In a sense, the procedural programming uses a straightforward approach in putting
each of the step needed in the code. Additionally, this requires the repetition of lines in a code when repeating the exact same steps but 
with a different value or variable. On the other hand, the OOP creates various objects and class to execute the problem. This is analogous 
to playing LEGO bricks because each pieces of bricks make up the lego in the same way that objects make up the whole code. These bricks or 
objects has their respective attributes and can perform their respective methods for a more efficient code than procedural programming. 
    
    For instance, the procedural programming could list each step or mathematical function needed to solve the latitude. This would require
a lot of lines and repeating steps. On the other hand,OOP could use class and objects to easily solve for different latitude instead of manually 
doing it in step-by-step manner. OOP focuses on using different objects to execute the code through their own attributes or methods. Ultimately,
OOP makes the code efficient and reusable.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses a system of visual representation added in creating programs and applications. They offer designs 
or styles, buttons, text, and other visual aids that can be incorporated in the creation of applications. In the field of geomatics, GUI
can be used to add visual and interactive interface for users. It also follows the database, server, and front-end idea wherein the data-
base serves as the source of information, the server comprises of all the functions and methods, and the front-end as the final output
that users see. 
    In geomatics, GUI can be used in things like modals, map or map making, creation of application, websites and others. For instance, GUI plays a
crucial role in creating websites for Government agencies to display a map of a certain topic or issue. One example is the map of the COVID-19
patients or the number of COVID-19 in the Philippines that was seen from the DOH website, if I remember correctly. Moroever, NAMRIA and PAGASA
utilize GUIs in their web that displays bodies of water or active volcanoes or fault lines in the country.

    Operation Overloading in OOP basically means that it is possible to use the same function or function name throughout the code but with 
different parameters without any problems. However, too much use of this could also ruin the whole programming. It should be used appropriately
when coding. 
    For instance, one could use the same function name for a number of times with different parameters. It is expected that the code will work
because of operation overloading in OOP. Basically, operation overloading can repeat the names without errors. Through this, mapapadali ang buhay
because, for instance, it could abuse or use + operation multiple times. 

4. 
    Object-oriented programming follows the idea of inheritance for a more efficient and productive code. Inheritance means that a child class
or subclass inherits some of the attributes or methods of its parent class or superclass. This concept allows for creation of multiple class
(subclass) that is connected with the parent class or superclass and at the same time executes this in a different manner.
    In OOP, inheritance could also allow the child class to improve or overwrite a parent class if necesarry. Subclass also inherits their
attributes and methods and perform their own. In a sense, the child class is created based from the parent class. Another example is creating 
a class of a person with parameters like age and sex. One could create sub class of different persons (person1, person2, etc) with different
age or sex. With this, they inherited the same attributes of the parent class. In this example the subclass inherited the age and sex 
attributes but with different value since each person could differ in their age and sex.

    In full stack-development, front-end, back-end, and database is the concept mainly followed. Database comprises of all the necessary
data or information needed. It stores all of the available data. Also, back-end includes this database and the server. The server does all the 
work in creating the code. It uses all of the necessary functions and methods for the execution of the code. Lastly, front-end includes the user
interface (UI) that is seen and interacted with by the users.
    In simple words, the database stores all of the ingredients needed in a restaurant. On the other hand, the server is the main chef
that is responsible in cooking using the ingredients. And the front-end are those seen by the customers such as the waiters who took their
orders and serves the food. In general, back-end includes the database and server.
