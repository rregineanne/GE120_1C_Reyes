    Procedural programming follows a step by step coding of a task. It uses the basics of the programming language in executing
the task. Additionally, this requires the repetition of lines in a code when repeating the exact same steps but with a different
value or variable. On the other hand, functional programming allows an easier and efficient way in getting the same outputs in 
procedural programming. Basically, this usees a function that can lessen the repetition of lines or the number of lines of codes.
    When following the procedural programming, the use of a numerous lines is done. On the other hand, various functions can be used in 
functional programming to avoid a great number of lines and prolonged steps in coding. When using functional programming, one can define 
a function and identify the steps involved under it. When done, it should return the resulting value or output.  For instance, one can  
make their own function that will display the outputs according to their desired parameters. To elaborate further, I can create a function
that will get the latitude of a given line. To avoid numerous computation of latitude per given line. this function can help ease the task. 
Ideally, this would solve the latitude based on the given distance and azimuth.

    Git is a free application that extends the local branches of your code to the internet. This is done through the use of repositories
wherein the folders, files, or any changes within the code in your computer is committed and pushed on the application. For instance, we 
can start by making a new repository on the Git Hub and then cloning it to your computer. With this, we can make changes to the repository
and synch the changes on the Git. 
    Indeed, Git helps in the collaborative development and version control environment of the programming because it promotes felxibility 
and teamwork. Through the use of repository, the owner and contributor can access the folders or files of one's code. Furthermore, they can
pull your code and work on it by themselves without altering the original copy that is pushed by the owner on the Git Hub. Basically, people
can collaborate with each other in making parts of a code and even altering such.
    For instance, people can work on different parts of a code in making an application. A group can assign each other a task to code in 
accomplishing the making of an application. Through Git, they can access, make copies, or even alter a few parts of the code. They can alter
these by pulling the file or code. Likewise, collaborators can see the history in Git whenever a change is done.  Ultimately, this helps in 
having an organized list of codes that will be needed to make the application as a last step.

    In an iteration or repetition, while loop is used when the number of times to repeat the code is unknown. 
On the other hand, for loop is used when the number of times needed to repeat the code is known. While loop allows
the repetition of the code until a desired condition or value. And for loop allows the repetition of the code with the 
given number of times. 
    In applying iteration or repetition in the field of geomatics, there could be a number of ways in using the while loop
and for loop. For instance, the code can continue the while loop depending on the number of times that we input a distance
and azimuth value in solving for a traverse. This will continue the loop depending on the number of lines or stations during
the laboratory. This does not limit the number of input. On the other hand, for loop can be used when formatting the result in
a traverse on a table. Througn for loops, the number of lines per row can be formatted until there are no more lines to print or
display. Another example is the use of for loops in faster solving of areas of subdivisions like subdivisions of residential areas.
Through the use of for loop, the code can ask for an input of length and width of a subdivided area three times. Under this, it can
solve for the area through equations or functions. Then, it will break or end when the input is asked three times. With this, one
can compare if the three areas computed are subdivided properly in a residential area.

    The divide and conquer paradigm in programming basically follows the idea that a vague or wide problem is furthere divided 
into subproblems to be able to solve it. In the practice of programming, an unambiguous or specific problem is generally used to
be able to solve a part of another big problem. This makes it easier to solve the big problem in a step by step manner. 
    For instance, there is a problem regarding the lack of residential area. Since it is a very wide topic, we can subdivide this into 
other problems under it. One problem that we can solve is the land or area distribution among families. With this, we can make a code that
can divide a certain area depending on how many houses are required. Furthermore, we can make a code to verify that the area is
subdivided correctly following the computations in subdivision. 

5. 
    Programming has a wide variety of application in the field of Geomatics. In general, programming allows the execution of a task 
to be done in a fast and efficient way. In the field of Geomatics, one of the many task that is done manually include the area subdivision.
This is commonly done with residential areas that are divided into parts to accomodate the number of houses for different families. As 
previously mentioned, we can have a code that will automatically compute for the specific area of a subdivided land depending on how many 
area could fit into the ideal area of one house. Furthermore, we can use programming to improve this subdivision and make sure that 
each land is divided equally. This will aid geodetic engineers in solving for area subdivision.
